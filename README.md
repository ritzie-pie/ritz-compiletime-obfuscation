# ritz-compiletime-obfuscation | C++ macro that is used for obfuscation, macro is used to end lines instead of using a semicolon.

## Description
The ritz-compiletime-obfuscation project provides a powerful compile-time obfuscation macro, RITZ_OBF_ENDL, designed to enhance the security and integrity of C++ programs by making reverse engineering significantly more difficult. By inserting complex, non-functional code blocks, this macro ensures that the program remains functional while obfuscating the source code to confuse and deter decompilers and static analysis tools.

## Key Aspects
- Compile-Time Obfuscation: Generates extensive and intricate code sequences during compilation, adding layers of non-functional operations to obscure the program's logic.
- Code Integrity: Maintains the original functionality of the code while introducing obfuscation, ensuring seamless operation.
- C++ Standard Support: Compatible with C++14 and higher versions, providing flexibility for integration into modern C++ projects.

## What It Actually Does
The RITZ_OBF_ENDL macro inserts a sequence of 500 lines of obfuscated code at the end of a line, utilizing a variety of operations to create a convoluted and complex code block. This technique is designed to disrupt the readability and decompilation process, making it challenging for reverse engineers to analyze and understand the code.

Example of RITZ_OBF_ENDL Operation:
``` cpp
std::cout << "Hello World\n" RITZ_OBF_ENDL
```

macro snippet that introduces an extensive block of obfuscated code:
``` cpp
#define RITZ_OBF_ENDL ; \
{ \
    int a = 1, b = 2, c = 3; \
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) { a += b; b += c; c += a; } \
    double d = 0.1, e = 0.2, f = 0.3; \
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) { d += e; e += f; f += d; } \
    char g = 'a', h = 'b', i = 'c'; \
    for (int j = 0; j < 10; ++j) { g += h; h += i; i += g; } \
    int arr[10] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}; \
    for (int j = 0; j < 10; ++j) { arr[j] = arr[(j+1)%10] + arr[(j+2)%10]; } \
```
